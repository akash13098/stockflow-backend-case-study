1.DATABASE SCHEMA DESIGN:
    a.creating tables with columns, data types, and relationships:-
      1.companies:
        companies (
          id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
          name VARCHAR(255),
          created_at TIMESTAMP
        )

      2.warehouses:
        warehouses (
          id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
          company_id UUID REFERENCES companies(id),
          name VARCHAR(255),
          location TEXT
        )


      3.Products:
        products (
          id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
          company_id UUID REFERENCES companies(id),
          name VARCHAR(255),
          sku VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
          price DECIMAL(10,2),
          product_type VARCHAR(50),
          created_at TIMESTAMP
        )

      4.inventory:
        inventory (
          id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
          product_id UUID REFERENCES products(id),
          warehouse_id UUID REFERENCES warehouses(id),
          quantity INT,
          updated_at TIMESTAMP,
          UNIQUE(product_id, warehouse_id)
        )

      5.inventory_logs
        inventory_logs (
          id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
          product_id UUID,
          warehouse_id UUID,
          change_quantity INT,
          reason VARCHAR(100),
          created_at TIMESTAMP
        )

      6.Suppliers:
        suppliers (
          id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
          name VARCHAR(255),
          contact_email VARCHAR(255)
        )

      7.Product suppliers:
        product_suppliers (
          product_id UUID REFERENCES products(id),
          supplier_id UUID REFERENCES suppliers(id),
          PRIMARY KEY(product_id, supplier_id)
        )

      8.Product_Bundles:
        product_bundles (
          bundle_product_id UUID REFERENCES products(id),
          child_product_id UUID REFERENCES products(id),
          quantity INT,
          PRIMARY KEY(bundle_product_id, child_product_id)
        )

2.Identifying Gaps:
  Questions to ask product team:
     1. Can suppliers serve multiple companies?

     2. Can one product have multiple suppliers with priority?
      
     3. What defines “recent sales activity”? (7 days? 30 days?)
      
     4. How are bundle inventories deducted? (auto or manual?)
      
     5. Are warehouses shared across companies?
      
     6. Can products exist without inventory?
      
     7. Do we need soft deletes?
      
     8. Should inventory go negative?
      
     9. Do prices vary per warehouse?
      
     10. Are SKUs unique globally or per company?


3.Design decesion explanation: I designed the schema by separating core business entities such as companies, warehouses, products, inventory, and suppliers
to keep the data normalized and avoid duplication. Inventory is modeled as a separate table because the same product can exist in multiple warehouses with 
different quantities, and a unique constraint ensures only one inventory record per product per warehouse. Inventory logs are included to track stock changes 
over time for auditing and troubleshooting. Suppliers are linked to products using a many-to-many relationship to allow flexibility in sourcing. Bundle products
are handled through a self-referencing table that defines which products are included in a bundle. Indexes are added on commonly queried fields like SKU and
foreign keys to improve performance and scalability as the system grows.
